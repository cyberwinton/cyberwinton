- 👋 Hi, I’m @cyberwinton
- 👀 I’m interested in many things - reading, personal training, and all things music. Some call me a jack of all trades, but I call myself a master of none.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to become a cybersecurity professional. I'm enrolled in Springboard's cybersecurity track, and I'm set to take my CompTIA Security+ SY0-601 exam very soon!
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything and everything that will help me get hands-on experience. I would love to learn more about all of the tools that cybersecurity professionals use and just make them a part of my everyday routine while I try to build and break down machines.
- 📫 How to reach me: You can send me a message on LinkedIn at https://www.linkedin.com/in/wintonfong
